            <t>
                Teleport is a minimal type system designed as an extension of
                JSON. It comes with 10 types sufficient for basic use, but
                it defines a pattern for extending it with arbitrary types.
                Teleport's type definitions are JSON values, for example, an
                array of strings is defined as {"Array": "String"}.
            </t>
            <t>
                Teleport implementations can be used for data serialization,
                input validation, for documenting JSON APIs and for building
                API clients.
            </t>
            <t>
                This document provides the mathematical basis of Teleport and
                can be used for implementing libraries.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                In Teleport, a type is a relation between a type definition
                and a value space. For example:
            </t>
            <figure>
                <artwork><![CDATA[
   t("Integer") = {0, -1,  1, -2,  2, -3,  3, ...}]]></artwork>
            </figure>
            <t>
                Here "Integer" is a type definition and t("Integer") is the set
                of all values this type can take. The t function is used to
                represent this relationship.
            </t>
            <t>
                Because Teleport is based on JSON, all value spaces are sets of
                JSON values. More interestingly, type definitions are JSON
                values too, which makes it trivial to share them with other
                programs.
            </t>
            <t>
                Teleport's design goals is to be a natural extension of JSON,
                be extremely lightweight, and extendable not only with rich
                types but with high-level type system concepts.

                <t>
                    Throughout this document, an extended JSON syntax is used.
                    Unquoted strings are symbols representing JSON values,
                    sets and functions. Also, the following set theory syntax
                    is used:
                </t>

                        <t hangText="a :: A">
                            Set A contains element a.
                        </t>
                        <t hangText="D -> C">
                            The set of functions that map values from set D

                        </t>
                    </list>
                </t>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section title="Type Patterns">
            <t>
                Types defined simply by a string, like "Integer" above, are
                called concrete. Teleport ships with 7 concrete types.
            </t>
            <t>
                A generic type maps a set of schemas to a set of value spaces.
                Each pair in the mapping is called an instance. For example,
                {"Array": "Integer"} is an instance of the Array type.
            </t>
            <t>
                Three generic types are provided: Array, Map and Struct. Their
                precise definition is provided in the following sections, but
                these examples should be enough to understand how they work:
            </t>

            <figure>
                <artwork><![CDATA[
   ["foo", "bar"]       :: t({"Array": "String"})

   {"a": 1, "b": 2}     :: t({"Map": "Integer"})

   {"name": "Alexei"}   :: t({"Struct": {
                                "required": {"name": "String"},
                                "optional": {"age": "Integer"}})]]></artwork>
            </figure>
        </section>

        <section title="JSON Schemas">
            <t>
                "Schema", one of the build-in concrete types, is defined as
                the set of all known type definitions. This is made possible by
                the fact that type definitions are JSON values. The Schema type
                is useful to specify APIs. For example, to describe a function
                you can use this:
            </t>
            <figure>
                <artwork><![CDATA[
   t({"Struct": {
        "optional": {},
        "required": {
           "input": "Schema",
           "output": "Schema"}}}]]></artwork>
            </figure>
        </section>

        <section title="Mathematical Basis">
            <t>
                The set of all JSON values is called V. A subset of V is called
                a value space and the set of all value spaces is called S.
                <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
                    <t>
