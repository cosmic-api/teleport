# Teleport Specification

The [first Internet Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-boronine-teleport/) has been submitted on Nov 10, 2014. I welcome you to join the [discussion](https://github.com/cosmic-api/teleport/discussions). Teleport is brand new and requires lots of help and insight to grow.

There is an [implementation in Python](https://github.com/cosmic-api/teleport.py) that needs to be updated to match the new spec. It is a tiny library finding a lot of good use for my current contract job. More language ports are expected soon.

Build:
